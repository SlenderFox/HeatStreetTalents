# Heat Street Talents Revival
Heat Street Talents Revival plans to be a complete remake of the workshop gamemode from the ground up.

It follows from [Heat Street Talents [KFVAY]](https://workshop.codes/KFVAY) by LemonAid.

I have ported Heat Street Talents [KFVAY] to [OSTW](https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Overwatch-Script-To-Workshop) which you can find in [original/](./original/) folder; it is not a pure port as I originally planned to just give the gamemode a touch up.

See [Ideas.md](ideas.md) for further info.
