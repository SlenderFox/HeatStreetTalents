# Ideas
A starting room that players are not allowed to leave until the mode starts.  
A ready-up system to avoid one player accidentally starting the mode without everyone.  
A countdown before the mode starts so it's less sudden.
## Priorities
Interesting, but can be ignored. Quite costly to buy but free to swap.
## Upgrades
Reduce the strength of each tier but add more tiers.  
Can buy normal health, shield health, and armour health.  
Can buy increased damage and increased healing.
### Haste
Look into ways to get it working with:
- Abilities with charges
- Ashe's coach gun
- Bastion's turret form
- Genji's swift strike
- Soldier: 76's helix rockets.
## Abilities
The per round random is an interesting idea and makes each playthrough unqiue however it can lead to minor frustration when you never get the abilities you want. Also it leads to a kind of boring meta where you should never spend any money on normal upgrades and sometimes talents and instead spend it all on abilities until you have what you need.
### Bulletstorm
If Blizz still haven't fixed new heroes in workshop, maybe shelve this.  
Also causes issues with peacekeeper alt fire.  
I wonder if there is a way to increase reload speed.
### Shockproof
Remove speed bonus, passthrough, and armour.
## Active Abilities
Have a cooldown. Activated with melee. Expensive to purchase into but free to swap. Often ignored.
## Talents
No talents with quick melee to avoid any conflicts with active abilities.  
What if I made 3 talents per hero, two abilities and one ult.  
Hack should disable talents.
### Ashe
- White phosphourous: Dynamite burn lasts twice as long and killing burning enemies sets nearby enemies on fire.
- Black powder: Coach gun stuns all enemies hit for 1.5 seconds.
### Baptiste
Corrode is good, great for AOE damage.
### Cassidy
Magnetic grenade talent no longer valid.
### D.va
Something with her micro-missiles.
### Echo
Rename Bomber Jacket to Sticky Bomb Salvo.  
Focusing optics is strong but quite boring and unengaging.
### Hazard
### Illari
Enemies will never shoot pylon.  
Her ult is really strong.  
Enemies near pylon take increased damage.
- Solar flare: Outburst deals more damage and sets enemies on fire.
### Juno
### Lifeweaver
Current talents are very boring.
Something with tree.
### Mauga
Naturally strong in pve.
Cage fight is ineffective against tough enemies.
### Orisa
- Shrapnel: Javelin Spin fires many pellets that deal damage and knockback.
- Tailwind: Increases Javelin Throw projectile speed and deals knockback and damage around impact point.
### Pharah
- Rocket Queen: Using Jump Jet or Jet Dash fires a small group of homing rockets.
### Sojourn
Remove explosive headshots. Maybe make all railgun shots deal explosive damage? Scaled by the charge of the shot.
### Sombra
Invisibility sents sombra to the lowest priority, and she is completely invisible for the first 8 seconds.  
Do something powerful with EMP.
### Venture
Burrow is strong.  
Ult is very strong.
- Plow: Drill dash hits in a larger area and knocks enemies down.
### Widowmaker
One ability should improve her effectiveness against boss enemies while the other should improve her effectiveness against crowds.  
Would be cool if I could do something with venom mine. Maybe make it spread?  
Explosive headshots are an easy talent idea, good fallback if I cannot think of anything else.
## Enemies
Enemy spawn quota: The game expects an amount of each type of enemy to spawn and will select a random enemy type to fill that quota.  
Quota scales with difficulty.  
Enemy respawn times scale with difficulty.  
Every enemy has an aggressiveness number calculated based on their current situtation. They also have a confidence number. The ai uses this to determine if it should perform certain actions.
### Brigitte - Guard
Will try and protect teammates.  
Has a preference for certain types.
## Maps
For now I would only like to do Kanezaka; I am tired of Chateau Guillard.  
It is unlikely I would be able to fit many maps into one gamemode and might be limited to only one.  
Eventually I would like to do all dedicated deathmatch maps, comverted deathmatch maps, and maybe the elimination maps and Ayutthaya.
