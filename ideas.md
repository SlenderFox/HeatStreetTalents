# Ideas
## Enemies
Enemy spawn quota: The game expects an amount of each type of enemy to spawn and will select a random enemy type to fill that quota. Quota scales with difficulty.  
Enemy respawn times scale with difficulty.
## Abilities
### Haste
Look into ways to get it working with charged abilities, Ashe's coach gun, and Bastion's turret form, Soldier: 76's helix rockets.
### Bulletstorm
If Blizz still haven't fixed new heroes in workshop, maybe shelve this. 
Also causes issues with peacekeeper alt fire.
### Shockproof
Remove passthrough.
## Talents
What if made 3 talents per hero, two abilities and one ult.
### Ashe
- White Phosphourous: Killing burning enemies sets nearby enemies on fire.
### D.va
Something with her micro-missiles.
### Lifeweaver
Current talents are very boring.
### Illari
Enemies will never shoot pylon.  
Her ult is really strong.  
- Outburst deals damage and sets enemies on fire
- Enemies near pylon take increased damage
### Mauga
Naturally strong in pve.  
Cage fight is ineffective against tough enemies.
### Venture
Burrow is very strong.
Ult is very good.
Maybe something with melee.
Something with drill dash.
