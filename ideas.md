# Ideas
## Enemies
Enemy spawn quota: The game expects an amount of each type of enemy to spawn and will select a random enemy type to fill that quota. Quota scales with difficulty.  
Enemy respawn times scale with difficulty.
## Abilities
### Haste
Look into ways to get it working with charged abilities.
### Bulletstorm
If Blizz still haven't fixed new heroes in workshop, maybe shelve this.
## Talents
### Lifeweaver
Current talents are very boring.
### Illari
Enemies will never shoot pylon.  
Her ult is really strong.  
- Outburst deals damage and sets enemies on fire
- Enemies near pylon take increased damage
### Mauga
Naturally strong in pve.  
Cage fight is ineffective against tough enemies.
### Venture
Burrow is very strong.
Ult is very good.
Maybe something with melee
