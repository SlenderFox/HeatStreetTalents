# Ideas
## Enemies
Enemy spawn quota: The game expects an amount of each type of enemy to spawn and will select a random enemy type to fill that quota.  
Quota scales with difficulty.  
Enemy respawn times scale with difficulty.
## Abilities
Reduce the strength of each tier but add more tiers.
### Haste
Look into ways to get it working with:
- Abilities with charges
- Ashe's coach gun
- Bastion's turret form
- Genji's swift strike
- Soldier: 76's helix rockets.
### Bulletstorm
If Blizz still haven't fixed new heroes in workshop, maybe shelve this.  
Also causes issues with peacekeeper alt fire.  
I wonder if there is a way to increase reload speed.
### Shockproof
Remove speed bonus and passthrough.
## Talents
No talents with quick melee to avoid any conflicts with active abilities.
What if I made 3 talents per hero, two abilities and one ult.
### Ashe
- White phosphourous: Dynamite burn lasts twice as long and killing burning enemies sets nearby enemies on fire.
- Black powder: Coach gun stuns all enemies hit for 1.5 seconds.
### Cassidy
Magnetic grenade talent no longer valid.
### D.va
Something with her micro-missiles.
### Hazard
### Illari
Enemies will never shoot pylon.  
Her ult is really strong.  
Enemies near pylon take increased damage.  
- Solar flare: Outburst deals more damage and sets enemies on fire.
### Juno
### Lifeweaver
Current talents are very boring.
Something with tree.
### Mauga
Naturally strong in pve.  
Cage fight is ineffective against tough enemies.
### Sojourn
Remove explosive headshots. Maybe make all railgun shots deal explosive damage? Scaled by the charge of the shot.
### Sombra
Invisibility sents sombra to the lowest priority, and she is completely invisible for the first 8 seconds.  
Do something powerful with EMP.
### Venture
Burrow is strong.  
Ult is very strong.  
- Plow: Drill dash hits in a larger area and knocks enemies down.
### Widowmaker
One ability should improve her effectiveness against boss enemies while the other should improve her effectiveness against crowds.
Would be cool if I could do something with venom mine. Maybe make it spread?
Explosive headshots are an easy talent idea, good fallback if I cannot think of anything else.
